MedBridgeAPI
============

This MedBridge class is used to interact with MedBridge Education's Patient Care Vendor API.

This is only an example of how to use the API.  This is NOT a full implementation and doesn't have complete error handling.

In order to use please modify the const.php.example file and rename it to const.php.
