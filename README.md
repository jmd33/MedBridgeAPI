MedBridgeAPI
============

This MedBridge class is used to interact with MedBridge Education's Patient Care Vendor API.

This is only an example of how to use the API.  This is NOT a full implementation and doesn't have complete error handling.

In order to use please add a const.php file and define your 'API_KEY' and a 'CLINICIAN_EMAIL' constants.
